elim is currently alpha software. 
Use at your own peril.

Having said that, you will need the following packages (including header files,
if your distro ships the -dev or -devel part as a separate package):

glib-2.0 
libxml-2.0 
purple 
libxml-2.0

Note that the makefile will try to detect these and will complain if it 
can't find them.

You will also need GNU Make and a C compiler.

Assuming the build dependencies are all installed, all you should need to 
do is:

  make

this should produce a binary called "elim-client".

If you want to test the daemon using the (currently incomplete) elisp 
client suport, you need to do the following:

* fire up emacs
* load elisp/garak.el
* customise or set elim-executable to the location of the elim-client binary
  (this step shuldn't be necessary now, but just in case it doesn't work)

M-x garak RET

To add an account:

  /add-account USERNAME PROTOCOL

eg:

  /add-account foo@jabber.org prpl-jabber
  /add-account blerg@irc.freenode.net prpl-irc

(the protocol names can be tab completed)

To configue extra account details:

  /configure-account foo@jabber.org

This will trigger an emacs widget based (defcustom style) UI being set up
for you to fill out the details in.

To login:

  /connect USERNAME

(USERNAME can be tab-completed once accounts have been added)

To join a channel/room/etc

on IRC:

  /join USERNAME #emacs

OR, if you are already in an account-specific buffer, such as an IRC channel
buffer, just:

  /join #emacs

The details vary per protocol, but garak should be able to figure out what's 
required if you just say /join USERNAME (or /join in an account-specific buffer)

To start a one-to-one conversation:

  /msg ACCOUNT BUDDY MESSAGE-TEXT

OR (in an account specific buffer)

  /msg BUDDY MESSAGE-TEXT

To add a buddy

  /add-buddy USERNAME BUDDY-NAME

OR (in an account specific buffer)

  /add-buddy BUDDY-NAME 

I haven't implemented starting a conversation with an individual IM user yet
(in the UI, elim is capable of this already), but that will follow shortly.

To leave a conversation:

  /part

To disconnect an account:

  /disconnect USER

OR (in an account specific buffer)

  /disconnect 

New garak buffers should turn up in the tracking block in the mode line:

  [#emacs,#elim,etc]

You can clock on the buffer names in the mode line or switch to them in the 
usual way.

That's all that's implemented for now, it's all only just been written so 
hasn't had a lot of testing.
