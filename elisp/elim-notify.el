typically provided by notification-daemon.
The arguments are passed as a list of keys and values, with :symbols as
keys. The keys are mapped to the Notify method's arguments by stripping
the leading : and replacing \"-\" with \"_\".

::action-handler specifies the function to be called if you pass an action
or actions to the Notify method and one is invoked. This handler will be
called with one argument: The key from the action list which corresponds
to the button pressed.

Example:

  (elim-notify-show-message :id       0
                       ::action-handler (lambda (a) (message \"action: %S\" a))

Since the arguments are named, you need not specify them in any order.
