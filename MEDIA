The media files included ( so far only a few icons ) are all from the pidgin 
(version 2.4.3) source package from debian woody, which is under the GPL v2.
The source files (.c, .h etc) are specifically stated as being GPLv2 or later.
The image files are not specifically or individually licenced as "or later",
so I guess they must be strictly GPL v2 licenced.
